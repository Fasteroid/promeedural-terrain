# GMod Procedural Terrain
My procedural terrain addon for Garrys Mod

If you want to try this for yourself, download and extract the code to GarrysMod/garrysmod/addons
##### AS OF NOW IT REQUIRES EP2 AND TF2 TO BE MOUNTED!

### Current Features: 
- Custom entity that acts as a displacement
- Custom lightmap with generated shading
- Customizable blendmap between 2 textures
- No uv/texture stretching
- Trees & grass foliage
- Menu with customizable settings & optional user-created LUA heightmap function
- All chunk, blending, foliage, and tree shading complete in under 10 seconds (with my specs)
- Lightmap calculations complete in under a minute (with my specs)
- Better performance than other displacement forest maps such as gm_fork and gm_boreas
- Tree & Rock collision
- Lakes / water system

### Planned Features & Bugfixes:
- Seasons/Biomes
- Import actual models instead of using them from EP2
- Fix a crash related to the 32Bit branch of gmod
