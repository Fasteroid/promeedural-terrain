### Current Features: 
- Custom entity that acts as a displacement
- Custom lightmap with generated shading
- Customizable blendmap between 2 textures
- No texture streaching
- Trees & grass foliage
- Menu with customizable settings & optional user-created LUA heightmap function
- All chunk, blending, foliage, and tree shading complete in under 10 seconds (with my specs)
- Lightmap calculations complete in under a minute (with my specs)
- Better performance than other displacement forest maps such as gm_fork and gm_boreas

### Planned Features & Bugfixes:
- Lakes using some kind of water system
- Seasons/Biomes

- Import actual models instead of using them from EP2
- Fix a crash related to the 32Bit branch of gmod
- More customizable features in the menu
- (Maybe) Pathways/Hiking Trails
